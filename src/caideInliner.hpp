    /// \li `-isystem` to setup system include search paths. In particular, you will likely need
    ///     to add builtin clang includes as a system path. See this link:
    ///     http://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibTooling.html#libtooling-builtin-includes
    /// \li `-D` for custom symbol definitions
    /// \li `-std=c++11` to specify a version of C++ standard
    /// \li `-fparse-all-comments' to take into account non-documentation comments
    /// \li `-v` for verbose output
    ///
    /// Other options you may need if they are not determined automatically (e.g. if
    /// the library was built in MinGW but you want to use Visual Studio headers, or if
    /// the library was built in a different Linux distribution):
    ///
    /// \li `-target` to specify compilation target (e.g., i386-pc-mingw32, i386-pc-windows-msvc,
    ///     i386-pc-linux)
